       <p>hello <strong>hi</strong> soham chakrabortty</p>
        <p1>This is a <em>paragraph</em> As you can see, I placed an empahisis on the word "paragraph".Now, I will change also the background color of the word "paragraph" to black, and its text color to red, all with just CSS.</p1><p>The main essence of this tutorial is to:<p>
        <ul>
            <li>show you how to format a web document with HTML</li>
            <li>show you how to design a web page with CSS</li>
            <li>show you how to program a web document with JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Next, I am going to add the following two numbers and display the result, all with JavaScript</p>
        
        <p>Frist number:<span id= "firstNum">2</span> <br></p>
        <p>second number: <span id= "secondNum">7</span> </p>
        <p>Therefore, the sum of the two of those numbers is: <span id= "answer">(placeholder for the answer)</span></p>
